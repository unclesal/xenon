# XENON

Please do not compile nor install it, because this project still does not do anything useful.

# Terms and agreements

- All sources are opened except server part. This is because a virtual server's rent is not free and I would like avoid uncontrolled grew of agents.

# I use

1. Beautiful (and officially purchased) flight simulator [X-Plane](https://www.x-plane.com/)

2. Free USSS (Kol'tsovo, Yekaterinburg, Russia) X-Plane scenery. The original scenery can be downloaded from [here](http://x-flight.su/ural.php).
I have modified this one for my purposes (all static airplanes and ground traffic has been removed). You can get
modified scenery from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZsokPeAb87V5MtS3KQzZL7dX1c05e4Z5/view?usp=sharing).

3. New generation X-Plane Multiplay Library supporting OpenGL, Vulcan, Metal standards, supporting TCAS and CSL OBJ8 
3D models, made by [TwinFan](https://github.com/TwinFan/XPMP2). You do not need to install it separately, as it compiles 
statically. But please pay attention to additional files in the [Resources](https://github.com/TwinFan/XPMP2/tree/master/Resources) 
subdirectory - they will be needed.

4. OBJ8 CSL 3D models package made by [Oktalist](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/37041-bluebell-obj8-csl-packages/). 
You can also download it from [Google Disk])(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8hGoqCV5Z5AcTM4ZWhIX2RZT2M), if this 
method is more convenient for you. It is important that the **X-Plane ROOT/Resources/plugins/xenon** directory has a subdirectory
**Resources/CSL** with the specified models.

5. [Boost](https://www.boost.org/), a set of modern C++ portable libraries, for working with graphs and various coordinate systems.
It also does not need to be specially installed, because most of it is included in the program itself during compilation.

6. [nlohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) modern C++ JSON realization (not need to be installed separately)
